# Restock Helper

Our project was requested by our client, La Eso. La Eso is a convenience store / restaurant in Juticalpa, Honduras. The store is located in a rural state, and often has issues of stock shortage and limited supplier visits. A supplier that arrives once a month may have a product one week, then run out for the next month without warning. Some products are processed, so counting the current inventory amount would involve translating the processed product into its components, and reducing those amounts from the inventory. The current method for ordering products relies solely on guesswork by the Inventory Administrator, which leads to running out of vital raw materials. 

Due to the CoVid-19 Pandemic and the rise in product shortages, it is of utmost importance to analyze sales and supplier activity in order to keep the stock at a safe amount, without damaging product quality. 



## Restock Helper Project Description

This application aims set alerts that can catch a person's attention, analyzes previous sales data in order to create an estimated restock amount, and give the number of days of stock there are available on the premises.

One of the inconveniences that we would like to address is keeping track of items that are sold under different names.  An example of this would be stocking twenty chickens and then selling ten wings, four breasts, and two thighs.

Our product will run on an Android Platform, but will also be available for IOS.



## Client Issues:
* The person in charge of ordering doesn’t have any type of notification system, so they often forget items when it is time to order.
 * If that person is sick, the person who fills in for them doesn’t know what to order.
  * We want to make it easier to rotate the person in charge.
* There are many providers for different and overlapping products that have different delivery schedules.
* There is no mathematical method used to analyze sales and trends.
* Physical inventory of raw products does not match digital processed products inventory.
* There is one big online inventory for two storage areas.
  * Make it two separate inventories
* Hard to keep track of ingredients (there are many items with no barcode)
  * Ex: buying mayo vs. selling a sandwich



## Our Goals 
1. Create an app for the company's Android Tablet.
2. Analyze previous sales trends and supplier delivery schedule to create an estimated restock amount.
3. Adapt it to client reports and system.
4. Send alerts when stock nears minimum.
